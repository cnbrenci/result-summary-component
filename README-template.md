## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

[Trick](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/62-5-percent-font-size-trick/) for never setting pixel font sizes and making them easier to compute in your head:

```css
html {
    font-size: 62.5%;
}

div {
  font-size: 1.8rem; /* This will be 18px */
}
```

Gained a better understanding of css selectors, in particular using [selector lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Selector_list) and the [:is()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is) pseudo-class to create a forgiving selector list.

Clip paths and creation of a circle with a gradient:

```css
.circle-gradient {
    background: #4d21c9;
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(77,33,201,1) 0%, rgba(37,33,201,0) 100%);
    clip-path: circle(40%);
    min-width: 24rem;
    min-height: 24rem;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-flow: column;
}
```
```html
<div class="circle-gradient">
  <h1>76</h1>
  <p><strong>of 100</strong></p>
</div>
```

todo: add screenshot

Process-wise, it's helpful to look through all the colors and font sizes in the figma at the start of the project and create the variables. That makes it quicker 

A powerful way to use CSS variables is to create variables based on other variables. This can be useful for keeping track of color schemes and to keep CSS rules modular.  It can help to avoid needing complex / specific css rules and keep things more general. For example, if there are multiple h2, h3, p across the project but each section has a different color scheme, redifining the color scheme in variables for each section might be a good idea instead of adding more css selectors.

todo: add an example of how we're re-defining css variables to style the different parts of the component instead of using complex css rules.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
``` -->

<!-- ```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->
